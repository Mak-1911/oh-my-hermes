# Review instructions

**Who reads this file.** Today it is read explicitly, by the `review-sweep`
skill in `.claude/skills/review-sweep/` and by anyone reviewing a PR by hand.
Nothing reads it automatically. Anthropic's managed Code Review service picks
up a root `REVIEW.md` on its own, but that service is a separate paid product
and is not enabled here; the `claude-code-action` GitHub Action and the local
`/code-review` command both ignore this file. So treat it as the written policy
a reviewer is expected to load, not as configuration that enforces itself.

oh-my-hermes is pure Python 3.11+ with zero runtime dependencies. Core `omh`
code makes no LLM, API, or network calls and never patches Hermes. Most defects
here are **contract drift**, not algorithmic bugs. Weight the review that way:
a correct-looking function that desynchronizes a generated artifact or a pinned
count is worse than an awkward loop.

## What Important means here

Reserve Important for findings that break a contract or ship a false claim.

- A generated artifact was hand-edited instead of regenerated from its source.
  The edit is silently lost on the next regeneration and fails a byte-exact
  gate. See the table below.
- A routing case, skill, or demo card was added without updating the
  exact-count assertions that pin it (`case_count`, `intervention_case_count`,
  and friends). Those counts are the contract, not noise.
- A routing trigger uses a raw substring check instead of the normalized
  helpers (`normalized_phrase`, `routing_tokens`, `contains_cue_phrase`).
- A routing or policy trigger ships without a negative case. A positive-only
  trigger is incomplete, not merely under-tested.
- Evidence language claims execution, review, CI, or merge that did not happen.
  `prepared_not_observed` is never execution evidence.
- A network, LLM, or API call was added to core `omh` code, or a new runtime
  dependency was introduced. The one sanctioned execution surface is
  `omh coding fanout dispatch`.
- A broad `except` was added without a verdict in
  `tests/test_broad_exception_policy.py`.
- User-facing CLI output was made Korean-only, or localized output began
  auto-detecting the OS locale instead of requiring `--language` / `OMH_LANG`.
- Codex was made the implicit default owner in wording, schemas, or reports
  where Claude Code, Hermes runtime, and generic executors are equally valid.

Style, naming, structure, and refactoring suggestions are Nit at most.

## Generated artifacts — never hand-edited

A PR that edits the right-hand column without the left-hand column is an
Important finding.

| Source of truth | Generated file |
| --- | --- |
| `src/skills/catalog.py`, `src/skills/render.py` | `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `skills/*/references/*.md` |
| same catalog data | `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` |
| same catalog data | `docs/ROLES.md` |
| demo case engine | `examples/use-cases/g1-g10-demo-cards.json` |
| `capability_family_projection()` in `src/capabilities/families.py` | `src/plugin_bundle/omh/tools/capability_families.json` |

The gates are byte-exact. A one-character drift fails CI.

## Cap the nits

Report at most five Nits per review. If you found more, say "plus N similar
items" in the summary instead of posting them inline. If everything you found
is a Nit, lead the summary with "No blocking issues."

## Do not report

- Anything CI already enforces: Ruff (Pyflakes `F` only) and `compileall`.
- Broad `except Exception` as a style matter. `BLE001` is deliberately not
  enforced; the policy is owned by issue #652 and gated by
  `tests/test_broad_exception_policy.py`. Only flag a broad `except` whose
  failure is neither classified nor surfaced.
- Anything under `build/lib/`. It is a gitignored stale copy of old sources,
  not live code.
- Missing type annotations, docstring style, or line length. None are enforced.
- Test-only code that intentionally violates production rules.

## Verification bar

Behavior claims need a `file:line` citation in the source, not an inference
from a name. If you cannot point at the line that makes the claim true, either
drop the finding or state plainly that it is unverified.

Before claiming a test would fail, check whether the repo already solves the
problem elsewhere. This codebase has established patterns for skip guards,
symlink capability probes, and filesystem faults; a PR reinventing one is a
consistency finding with a concrete `file:line` alternative, not a bug.

## Always check

- New or changed routing behavior ships with both a positive and a negative
  case.
- A new installable skill touched every required surface. `docs/ADDING-A-SKILL.md`
  is the checklist; awareness lane, context card, ack/label/card coverage, and
  the capability-family sidecar are all easy to miss.
- Commits carry DCO `Signed-off-by:` plus the Lore-style trailers from
  `AGENTS.md`, with `Signed-off-by:` last.
- The PR body follows the repository template with real content. A one-line
  changelog for a user-facing change is a finding.
- Verification claims in the PR body match what the diff can actually support.

## Re-review convergence

A review round that can raise anything about anything never converges. From
the second round on, the review is a ratchet: it tightens around what is still
unresolved and does not re-open settled ground.

**Settled ground** is the diff the previous round was posted against, and only
as far as that round says it looked. A round that reviewed part of a PR — a
large diff, a partial pass, a skipped module — says so, and settles only what
it names. A shallow round one must not blind every round after it.

**Verdict** below means this file's tally (`1 important, 3 nits`,
`No blocking issues`). The `review-sweep` procedure posts `COMMENT` and never
approves or requests changes, so the tally is the only verdict it has. A
reviewer who does hold approve / request-changes power reads the same rules
with their verdict in place of the tally.

Six rules, in force from round two.

**Suppress new Nits.** Post Important findings only. A one-line fix must not
reach round seven on style.

**Scope findings to the delta — not your reading.** Round two and later raise
findings about two things: what changed since the round you last posted, and
whether the findings you raised then are resolved.

This constrains what you *report*, never what you *read*. Reading outside the
delta stays mandatory: the two headline Important findings in this repo are
things that should have changed and did not — a generated artifact whose
source moved without it, a count assertion three files away. Neither is
visible in the diff. **A finding whose cause is in the delta is a delta
finding, whichever file exhibits it.** Run the Step 4 gates every round; they
catch desync without reading anything.

**Justify novelty, or post it demoted and say why.** A new Important finding
on ground a previous round settled must say, in the finding itself, why it was
not visible then. Four reasons count, and the fourth is the honest one: a fix
revealed it, a file arrived, an assumption was disproved, or **you did not
examine this last round** — say that plainly. It costs you credibility, which
is the correct price, and it costs the repository nothing.

Without one of those, the finding is not Important this round: post it as a
Nit *with* the admission attached. It does not vanish — the nit-suppression
rule above does not apply to a demoted finding, because a suppressed finding
and a deleted finding are the same thing.

**Anything on the `What Important means here` list is exempt from demotion.**
A contract break is Important on discovery, in whatever round it surfaces. A
network call added to core `omh`, a false evidence claim, a hand-edited
generated artifact, a positive-only routing trigger: these stay Important
without a novelty sentence. Convergence pressure is not worth shipping one.

**Carryover blockers stay blocking.** A finding raised in an earlier round and
still unresolved blocks at its original severity no matter how many rounds
have passed — unless you withdraw it under the last rule, which is the only
thing that clears one other than a fix. Judge "resolved" to the same bar the
Verification bar sets for findings: point at the line that resolves it, or say
the resolution is unverified.

**A cleared round cannot be made worse.** When the previous round raised at
least one Important finding and this round finds all of them resolved, this
round's tally must not report more Important findings *on that same ground*.
The antecedent needs a non-empty set: a previous round with no Important
findings settles nothing and locks nothing. And this rule is subordinate to
the novelty rule above — a properly justified new Important finding stands on
its own and sets the tally, whatever this rule would otherwise say.

**Withdraw your own over-reach.** Before posting, re-read your previous round
against the Do-not-report list and the `What Important means here` list. A
demand that turns out to have been scope expansion, speculation, or a Nit
dressed as Important is your defect, not the author's: withdraw it in this
round's body and say so. A withdrawn finding stops being a carryover blocker.
Judge round one against those two lists only — the ratchet did not bind it.

State the round number and the SHA you are ratcheting against at the top of
the body, so the author can check the ratchet held. If the same finding is
disputed across two rounds, it goes to the maintainer rather than into a third
round; nothing here is a mandate to keep arguing.

## Summary shape

Open the review body with a one-line tally, for example `1 important, 3 nits`.
Lead with "No blocking issues" when that is the case. State the shape of the
work before the details.
