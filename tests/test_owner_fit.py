"""An owner is recommended only when evidence says it can finish the accepted plan.

The defect (#810): `resolve_coding_route_decision` chose a coding owner from an
owner named in the request envelope, an owner named in the message, a recorded
setup preference, or a keyword route-family cue -- and from nothing else. No
capability snapshot, no readiness probe, no look at what the plan needed. Its
payload had no requirement field, no gap field, and no unknown field. So a
person could name an owner, be told the handoff was prepared, and find out
mid-execution that the owner could not isolate a worktree or run the routed
workflow at all.

What these pin:

* AC1 -- an owner with a KNOWN unmet required capability is never recommended,
  asserted on the surfaces Hermes actually reads (the built delegation payload
  and the ranked choose-executor card), not only on the matcher.
* AC2 -- every required capability appears with its classification AND the
  evidence reference that produced it; a payload missing either fails
  validation.
* AC3 -- two owners holding equal capability evidence produce fit records that
  are equal once the two owner-identity fields are removed. A real differential:
  the same evidence is recorded under different owner ids and the verdicts,
  reasons, and classifications must not move.

`unknown` -- stale evidence and absent evidence both classify `unknown`, and
`unknown` is a third state with its own consequence: the owner is `unproven`,
which is neither recommended (AC1 stays strict) nor reported as a blocking gap.

Guards: an explicitly named unfit owner is still honoured and its gap is stated
rather than the owner disappearing, and equal evidence under different owner
ids does not move the verdict.
