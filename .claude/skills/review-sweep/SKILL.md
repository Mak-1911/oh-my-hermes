# Review sweep

Finds open pull requests carrying no review at their current head commit and
reviews them against `REVIEW.md`. Manual, idempotent per head SHA, and evidence
first: every finding is either reproduced or labeled as unverified.

## Invocation

| Input | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *(nothing)* | Sweep every open PR with no review at its current head |
| `771` | Review only PR 771, even if already reviewed |
| `--drafts` | Include draft PRs (skipped by default) |
| `--mine` | Include PRs you authored (skipped by default) |
| `--apply` | Actually post. Without it, print findings locally and stop |

**Default is dry run.** A review is a public, notifying write to someone else's
work. Print the findings, then stop and ask before posting.

## Step 1 — read the policy first

```sh
cat REVIEW.md
```

`REVIEW.md` is the contract for what counts as Important versus Nit in this
repository, what never to report, and the nit cap. Read it before looking at
any diff. Do not substitute generic review instincts for it — the whole point
is that this repo's defects are contract drift, not textbook bugs.

Also read `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` for the surrounding rules.

## Step 2 — find the work

```sh
gh pr list --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,author,isDraft,headRefOid,reviews \
  --jq '.[] | {n: .number, title: .title, author: .author.login,
               draft: .isDraft, head: .headRefOid,
               reviewed_at_head: ([.reviews[].commit.oid] | index(.headRefOid) != null)}'
```

Skip a PR when any of these hold, and say so in the report rather than
silently dropping it:

- it already has a review at the current `headRefOid`
- it is a draft and `--drafts` was not passed
- you authored it and `--mine` was not passed
- it is larger than roughly 2000 changed lines — review it alone, not in a
  sweep, and say so

## Step 3 — get the PR into a worktree

Never review from the diff text alone. This repo's defects are about whether a
change is consistent with code that is *not* in the diff — a reinvented helper,
a count assertion three files away, a generated artifact whose source did not
move. You cannot see any of that in a patch.

The main checkout is frequently on another branch and other agents move its
HEAD. Use a private worktree:

```sh
gh pr view <number> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid
git fetch origin pull/<number>/head:pr-<number>-head
git worktree add /tmp/omh-review-<number> pr-<number>-head
```

Work there. Remove it when done:

```sh
git worktree remove /tmp/omh-review-<number> --force
git branch -D pr-<number>-head
```

## Step 4 — run the gates the PR claims

The PR template carries a validation checklist. Contributors routinely leave it
unchecked. Running it yourself is the difference between a review that asserts
and a review that knows.

```sh
cd /tmp/omh-review-<number>
PYTHONPATH=tests uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests 2>&1 | tail -20
uv run --group lint ruff check src tests
uv run python -m compileall -q src tests
uv run python -m omh.cli docs workflows --check
uv run python -m omh.cli docs roles --check
uv run python -m omh.cli docs capability-families --check
git diff --check
```

CI only runs `docs workflows --check` of those three byte gates, so
`docs roles --check` and `docs capability-families --check` are yours to catch.

When the diff touches only a few modules, run those first for a fast signal,
then the full suite before you post:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=tests uv run python -m unittest tests/test_<module>.py -v 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Record the actual output. Quote it in the review. Never write "tests pass"
without the line that says so.

## Step 5 — find the defects

Work through `REVIEW.md`'s Important list against the diff. Beyond that, the
checks that pay off most in this repo:

- **Generated artifact without its source.** Did the PR edit
  `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`, `docs/ROLES.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, the demo cards, or
  the capability-families sidecar without changing `src/skills/catalog.py`,
  `render.py`, or `src/capabilities/families.py`? The edit will vanish on the
  next regeneration.
- **Reinvented pattern.** Before accepting a new helper, guard, or probe, grep
  for an existing one. Skip guards, symlink capability checks, and filesystem
  fault handling all have established forms here. Cite the existing
  `file:line`.
- **Count assertions.** A new routing case, skill, or demo card means an exact
  count somewhere is now wrong. Grep the four usual files:
  `tests/test_routing_precision.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`,
  `tests/test_hermes_ux_quality.py`, `tests/test_release_smoke.py`.
- **Positive-only trigger.** A routing change with no negative case is
  incomplete by the repo's own rule.
- **Evidence language.** Does the PR body claim CI, review, or execution it
  cannot support? Does it use `prepared_not_observed` as if it were execution
  evidence?
- **Commit trailers.** DCO `Signed-off-by:` present, last in the block, and
  matching the commit author.

```sh
git log origin/main..HEAD --format='%an <%ae>%n%b%n---'
```

Scope every grep to `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `skills/`. Matching a stale
string under `build/lib/` and reporting it as live code is a false finding, and
it is the most common way a review here embarrasses itself.

## Step 6 — verify before you post

For every candidate finding, do one of:

- **Reproduce it.** Write the smallest script or test that demonstrates the
  failure and keep the output. A reproduced defect is worth ten asserted ones.
- **Cite it.** Give `file:line` for the code that makes the claim true.
- **Drop it.** If you can do neither, it does not go in the review.

Findings you keep but could not fully verify must say so in their own words:
"I did not reproduce this" is honest and useful. A confident-sounding wrong
finding costs the author a round trip and costs you the next review's
credibility.

Apply the `REVIEW.md` nit cap — at most five, with the remainder as a count.

## Step 7 — post

Build the review payload as a file, not an inline heredoc:

```sh
cat > /tmp/review-<number>.json <<'EOF'
{
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "body": "...",
  "comments": [
    {"path": "tests/test_codegraph.py", "line": 287, "start_line": 275,
     "side": "RIGHT", "start_side": "RIGHT", "body": "..."}
  ]
}
EOF

gh api --method POST repos/rlaope/oh-my-hermes/pulls/<number>/reviews \
  --input /tmp/review-<number>.json
```

Hard-won constraints, learned by hitting them:

- **An inline comment must land inside a diff hunk.** Lines outside the hunk
  are rejected and take the whole payload down with them. Check the hunk ranges
  first with `gh pr diff <number> | grep '^@@'`. When the line you want is
  outside, put the suggestion in the review body as a fenced block instead.
- Use `event: "COMMENT"`, never `APPROVE` or `REQUEST_CHANGES`. This skill
  reports; the maintainer decides. `APPROVE` from an automated sweep is a false
  signal on a branch-protection gate.
- ` ```suggestion ` blocks are the highest-value form for a concrete fix — the
  author applies them in one click. An empty suggestion block deletes the
  lines.
- Verify it landed:

```sh
gh api repos/rlaope/oh-my-hermes/pulls/<number>/reviews --jq '.[-1] | {id, state, user: .user.login}'
gh api repos/rlaope/oh-my-hermes/pulls/<number>/comments --jq '.[] | {path, line, user: .user.login}'
```

### Idempotency

End the review body with a marker so a later sweep can tell it already ran:

```
<!-- review-sweep: head=<headRefOid> -->
```

Before reviewing, check for it:

```sh
gh api repos/rlaope/oh-my-hermes/pulls/<number>/reviews \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("review-sweep: head=<headRefOid>"))] | length'
```

Non-zero means this exact commit was already reviewed. Skip it.

### Re-reviews

When a PR already has a `review-sweep` review at an older SHA, follow the
`REVIEW.md` convergence rule: **Important findings only, no new nits.** Open
with what changed since the last review.

## Step 8 — report

Per PR: the gates you ran with their real output, findings by severity, what
you posted, and the review URL. Across the sweep: reviewed, skipped with
reasons, failed with errors.

If a gate failed to run — missing `uv`, a broken environment — say that
explicitly. An unrun gate is not a passing gate, and reporting it as one is the
exact failure mode `REVIEW.md` exists to prevent.

## Boundaries

- Posts reviews and comments. Never approves, merges, closes, or pushes.
- Never edits the PR's branch. A fix goes to the author as a suggestion.
- Never reviews the same head SHA twice without an explicit number argument.
- On a fork PR, the worktree contains untrusted code. Read it and run the
  repository's own test suite; do not run arbitrary scripts the branch adds.
