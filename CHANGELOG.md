# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented here.

## 1.0.6 - 2026-08-13

- Added typed unit-result sidecars for fan-out dispatch: `fanout_unit_result/v1` schema with structured process status, command evidence, and reporter-vs-observer provenance marks out exactly what was dispatched, what it reported, and what the dispatcher verified independently — replacing the exit-0 overclaim with a four-state vocabulary (`process_succeeded`, `result_schema_valid`, `unit_verification_observed`, `integration_ready`) that reflects the actual evidence ladder.
- Hardened worktree creation with runtime base-SHA validation, unique-branch enforcement, and crash-cleanup receipts logged to the observation journal.
- Added `executor_capability/v1` descriptive metadata to dispatch profiles: edit formats, persistent eval, tool reentry, and code-mode batching support, with provenance fields and `unknown` defaults (descriptive only, no routing coupling).
- Added `omh coding fanout status` read-only roster command that projects dispatch journal events into a unit-level summary table.
- Strengthened delegation guidance in the skill catalog with five bounded blocks: code-mode batching (capability-conditional), edit-format steering, resource-reference idiom, review-verdict format (P0-P3 priority framework), and commit-planning discipline.
- Added orchestration patterns documentation: boundary-policy rules with retry-from-checkpoint, and async advisor-as-reviewer contract with explicit severity gates.
- Added benchmark fixture discipline guidance: seeded deterministic mutations, fresh sessions, exact-equality grading, raw transcript retention, and first-party authored measurement labels.
- Added capability-shape parity documentation linking OMH-native schema contracts to the oh-my-pi designs that inspired them.
- Strengthened memory documentation: durability-receipt state vocabulary (`candidate_persisted`, `approved_record_persisted`, `indexes_refreshed`, `replay_ready`) and explicit learned-skill candidate-gate wording.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-08-08

- Added a message gate: every coding delegation now shows which skill ran, which executor and model it ran on, what evidence class the answer belongs to, and a digest of the prompt behind it, rendered by OMH as exact lines instead of asked for in skill prose. The composed Hermes order ships as its own follow-on message, bounded and fenced.
- Replaced the raw evidence vocabulary in everything a person reads. `prepared_not_observed` now renders as `Plan · not run`, `completed` as `Code · reported done`, and `worktree_failed` as `Setup · failed`, across chat, the status board, the route summary, the menu bar, and the README. The wire values are unchanged, so anything parsing them keeps working.
- Separated an executor's own claim from a checked result: a unit that reported itself finished no longer renders identically to one that passed a gate.
- Added `omh goal status --text`, so a goal ledger can be read as lines instead of escaped JSON.
- Added a coding handoff safety boundary, a single safety preflight with an opt-in organization rule source, a task authority envelope, and risky-action classification with run-bound approval receipts.
- Added external effect receipts, a normalized owner-progress vocabulary, safe blocked-work records with a decision history, and one shared append-only store with stale-update rejection.
- Made unit prompts skill-aware: fan-out work discovers, arranges, and interviews the skills available to the executor it is handed to.
- Gated follow-on engine starts on explicit user confirmation, and taught the delegate rules the real Claude Code permission-grant and session-resume mechanics.
- Made the capability policy changeable and enforced rather than advisory.
- Brought Windows to parity: the full suite runs on `windows-latest` in CI, journal lines stay LF, atomic replaces retry under sharing denials, and the installer path was fixed.
- Added CI gates for roles, capability families, and whitespace, plus a catalog deference gate covering the sibling relationships the catalog writes in prose.
- Bound observed workflows to snapshot evidence, and narrowed the plugin awareness markers to the routes they actually support.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-08-01

- Overhauled Hermes memory into a governed lifecycle: admission, evaluation, retention, expiry, and retirement policies, write-replay hardening, migration with reactivation for legacy stores, rollup signals, peer-perspective records, and record fusion, plus recall packs with freshness, budget, and conflict-aware sibling controls.
- Added a reviewed domain-intelligence store with an operator-controlled capture, review, approve, replace, and retire lifecycle, backed by descriptor-bound fail-closed snapshot validation and lineage, rejection, and retirement audit trails.
- Added domain-aware clarification: after a project-local domain profile is approved, an unresolved chat question can ask the exact catalog-owned expert question (English or Korean) for eight specialist workflows, while every already-resolved route, dispatch, and protected body stays byte-identical.
- Added eight specialist domain skills (sales development, finance analysis, legal compliance review, curriculum design, localization review, people ops, product brief, support operations) with domain-affinity ranking in the picker.
- Added model inventory routing: setup captures which coding agents and models are actually installed, and routing, main-agent composition, and dispatch recommendations follow that inventory instead of assuming a fixed owner.
- Added a research depth dial with declared shallow and deep chains, research-role routing, and a bounded executor prompt contract for prepared coding handoffs.
- Reworked dispatch ergonomics: choice-required dispatch when several owners fit, a unit verification protocol for fan-out work, delegation-protocol guidance across surfaces, and session follow-up handoffs that keep context across turns.
- Tightened routing quality with an accuracy program, overroute audits, picker-completion fixes, and clearer skill names and descriptions across the catalog.
- Made `omh update` report package-version and content movement explicitly, refresh every installed surface, and bust stale caches.
- Refreshed the README family with workflow GIFs, highlights, a uniform demo grid, and community links, and froze per-skill Korean copy behind explicit opt-in.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-07-26

- Added a `/omh` meta-router gateway skill with live-catalog routing, four Hermes setup-guide skills, and a generated full-catalog index reference so Hermes can discover the workflow surface from chat.
- Added an `omh-` display prefix to generated skill frontmatter, so a Hermes status line shows `omh-ultrawork` instead of a bare name that could belong to any skill, and made echo-back of those display names route correctly.
- Bounded the deep interview: every question now carries a `Round {n}/6` header with a clarity percentage over three fixed dimensions, and the interview stops on resolution, an explicit user stop, or the round budget.
- Reworked coding delegation around request-led states: coding route next actions split into four states, named coding-agent delivery takes precedence over advisor and feedback lanes, and setup asks one question with usage-time owner delegation.
- Added an opt-in local dispatch bridge that executes fan-out contracts in parallel against a deterministic merge contract, plus executor-scoped handoff validation.
- Made messenger rendering honor the render-profile contract on the chat route-hint path, which is the only limited-rendering path for the Hermes platforms that are not named individually, and made a present-but-unsafe body warn instead of passing silently.
- Surfaced wrapper degradation to chat users instead of dropping it at the wrapper, and taught progress reporting to detect claim/observation mismatches rather than only exempting them.
- Added an `omh doctor` advisory lane for the costliest Hermes misconfigurations, including noticing when the plugin is installed but disabled.
- Added a pinned Ruff static-analysis gate to CI and contributor docs, and a self-checking broad-exception policy gate.
- Cut repeated common-rail context in generated skills and bounded prompt, capability, stdout, and status payload budgets so shared context does not become prompt bloat.
- Defaulted skill-pack install to a core profile with opt-in full, and added a reconcile path from full back to core.
- Defaulted all setup and CLI output to English; localization is explicit opt-in through `--language` or `OMH_LANG`.
- Retired OMH worktree creation in favor of native Hermes and Git tooling.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-07-01

- Added stronger Hermes chat routing, workflow picker, direct-answer, file-lookup, and operator fast paths for common English and Korean requests.
- Added localized chat-card framing and release gates for localized copy, router fast paths, Hermes UX quality, routing precision, context brief coverage, route-hint alignment, and release evidence bundles.
- Added richer plugin, MCP, menu bar, codegraph, workflow-learning, source-finder, paper-learning, and worktree/session observation surfaces while preserving metadata-only evidence boundaries.
- Modernized the public site, README workflow presentation, docs, generated skill guidance, role context, and release readiness instructions around the Hermes-native wrapper contract.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-09

- Added the initial `omh` installer and Hermes skill workflow pack.
- Added a direct `src/` package layout for future growth.
- Added generated routing catalog and rendered skill content.
- Added open-source project operations files and GitHub templates.
