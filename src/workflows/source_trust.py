"""One mechanical ceiling on what an unobserved source is allowed to claim.

The defect this closes: OMH's evidence vocabulary answers exactly one question --
did OMH watch this happen. ``src/evidence/labels.py`` renders that as Phase x
Confidence, and every wire value on it (``prepared_not_observed``,
``observed_partial``, ...) is a statement about observation. Knowledge that
arrived from outside -- an upstream document, a practitioner's write-up -- has no
place on that axis, so it had two ways to be handled and both were wrong: drop it,
or let it ride into a report next to observed facts where a reader cannot tell
the two apart. The second is laundering, and prose telling an agent not to do it
is not a guard.

Two axes, kept apart on purpose, because welding them is the confusion:

* **Observation** -- did OMH see it. Owned by ``evidence.labels`` and the
  observed-claim guards in ``workflows.operator_productivity``. Nothing here
  touches it.
* **Source trust** -- what class of source stands behind a claim OMH never
  observed. ``upstream_official`` is primary or maintainer-published material.
  ``practitioner_heuristic`` is a named practitioner's report of what works for
  them, useful and unverified. ``unattributed`` is a claim with no identifiable
  source behind it.

The ceiling is mechanical, not advisory: :data:`TRUST_CLAIM_CEILING` says which
claim kinds each tier may back, and :func:`build_source_trust_claim` refuses the
record rather than recording a claim the tier cannot support. A
``practitioner_heuristic`` may back ``approach`` -- it can tell you how to go
about something -- and nothing further, so a tip structurally cannot appear as an
established finding. An ``unattributed`` source backs nothing at all; it is
recordable so that it is visible rather than silently dropped, which is the
difference between discarding knowledge and refusing to let it vote.

The strongest rule falls out of the table rather than being written on top of it:
NO tier reaches ``completion``. Not even ``upstream_official``. What is done,
passing, verified, reviewed, or merged is settled by observation alone, and
:data:`SOURCE_TRUST_TIERS` has no member that can say otherwise --
:func:`completion_is_never_source_backed` re-derives that from the table instead
of trusting the sentence you are reading.

Everything here is pure. OMH fetches nothing, subscribes to nothing, and ranks no
publisher: a caller states the tier, and this module decides only what that tier
is permitted to claim. Deciding WHICH sources are trustworthy is the reader's
judgement and stays outside OMH, per the ownership boundary in
``docs/DIRECTION.md`` that puts source-backed research on the Hermes side.
