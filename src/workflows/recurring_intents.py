"""Recurring-intent lifecycle records (`hermes_recurring_intent/v1`).

# Why this is a sibling record and not more fields on `hermes_ops_blueprint/v1`

There is one recurring-work concept in OMH, not two. A recurring intent is the
*lifecycle envelope* around a scheduled-ops blueprint: it never re-derives
cadence, delivery, or silence, it calls `build_scheduled_ops_blueprint` and
keeps the sub-records that builder produced. The blueprint stays the single
normalizer, and both records live under `.omh/hermes-ops/`.

The blueprint could not carry the lifecycle itself for three reasons:

1. `hermes_ops_blueprint/v1` is `projection_only` and write-once.
   `write_hermes_ops_blueprint` refuses to overwrite an existing id and there is
   no update path, because a projection of catalog metadata has nothing to
   update. A recurring intent is revised, activated, and accumulates occurrence
   links, so it needs a mutable record with a revision identity.
2. The blueprint validator refuses any nested `status` outside
   `{prepared, not_observed}` and any `*_status` that claims observation. An
   occurrence has to name an observed runtime run. Putting occurrences inside a
   blueprint would mean weakening exactly the guard that keeps blueprints
   honest, so occurrences live here and the guard itself is reused unchanged
   (`nested_status_boundary_errors`).
3. Blueprint identity is a timestamp plus a random suffix. Linking an
   occurrence to the exact intent it ran under needs a content digest, so a
   changed intent produces a different identifier on its own.

# What "paused" means structurally

`build_recurring_intent` has no parameter that can set an activation state or an
occurrence: a freshly built intent is not merely defaulted to paused, it has no
vocabulary for "an occurrence ran". The validator enforces the same rule for
records that arrive from disk or from a wrapper: with no recorded `activated`
transition, `occurrences` must be empty.

# What activation is

A recorded transition, never a flag flip. OMH runs no scheduler and no
background service. Activation is performed by an approved runtime surface
outside OMH; this record only stores who or what observed it, under which
approval reference, and at which revision. An activated intent is still not
execution evidence — each occurrence points at the runtime run that owns its
evidence.

# Why the failure policy extends v1 instead of becoming a sibling record

The record already carried one fifth of this policy: `overlap_posture`, whose
value was required to be explicit before activation while its handling was left
open. The remaining four decisions (missed run, retry, backfill, failure pause)
had to land in the same digested record, not beside it, for one reason that is
an acceptance criterion rather than a preference: an occurrence links to an
`intent_revision_id`, and the revision digest is what makes that link mean
something. A policy living outside the digest would let an occurrence recorded
under "skip when running, pause after 3 failures" read as evidence for "allow
concurrent, pause after 20" without the revision moving. So the four new
decisions join `REVISION_DIGEST_FIELDS`, and changing any of them produces a new
revision that the older occurrences do not cover.

`overlap_posture` stays at its own top-level path rather than moving under
`failure_policy`. It shipped with a validator branch, a CLI flag, a digest
input, and an activation gate; re-homing it would rewrite all of that to move
bytes. `FAILURE_POLICY_DECISIONS` names the path of each of the five decisions
instead, so the activation gate, the open-decisions list, the digest inputs, and
the human summary all read one table and none of them special-cases overlap.

# Where the boundary sits

The record *declares* the policy. `decide_recurring_occurrence` *projects* it
onto one situation an approved runtime surface reported, and returns what the
policy says plus the occurrence outcome to record. OMH still runs no scheduler:
it never starts, skips, queues, retries, or backfills anything, and a decision
payload is not evidence that the runtime did what the policy said. The one
behavior OMH does own is local and deterministic: a `failed` occurrence that
reaches the declared consecutive-failure threshold pauses this record, because
that is a mutation of local lifecycle metadata, not of anything running.
