"""Append-only workspace bindings: one workspace, one active handoff (issue #820).

What was missing
----------------

`coding/isolation.py` decides *whether* a handoff should run in its own
worktree, and `wrapper/worktree_binding.py` builds a recipe for opening one
executor in one path. Neither consults anything about the other handoffs. Two
`build_worktree_executor_binding` calls naming the same directory both
succeeded, and two handoffs on one branch were equally invisible, so the first
sign of a collision was a dirty tree or a lost commit.

This store is the missing exclusivity: an acquisition that either reserves a
canonical workspace for exactly one handoff, or explains who already holds it
and what to do about it.

Why this is its own record family
---------------------------------

The tree refused a new family twice (#811, #818) and accepted one twice (#807,
#808), on a rule worth restating: a family joins on run id, and a join is where
an artifact and its metadata desynchronize, so a field group on the record that
already exists is the default.

A binding earns a family on the dimension the rule is really about -- whose
question it answers. Every other record in this tree describes one run: what it
asked for, what a gate decided about it, what an operator consented to. A
binding describes a *resource*, and its whole value is that it is readable by a
handoff that has nothing to do with the one that wrote it. A field group on a
delegation is invisible to the next delegation by construction, which is
exactly the shape that let two handoffs claim one directory. It also outlives
the run that took it, because a released binding and an abandoned one must be
distinguishable after the turn that created either is over.

Exclusivity, and what it costs
------------------------------

Acquisition is serialized on the store's own OS lock -- `local_store.file_lock`,
real on POSIX and on Windows -- so the read of the active set and the append of
the new claim cannot interleave. Two concurrent acquisitions on one workspace
therefore produce one held binding and one refusal, not two winners.

That is exclusivity over *this store*, and the honest limit is that it is
exclusivity over nothing else. Nothing stops a person running `git worktree
add` twice, and nothing stops an executor already running from writing wherever
it likes. #820's own out-of-scope list excludes creating, deleting, or merging
worktrees, and the `workspace` boundary of `handoff_safety_contract/v1` still
reports `declared_not_enforced` because no OMH-side change can constrain a
running process. What the guard removes is the case OMH *does* own: enabling a
second workspace-bound handoff on a workspace or branch that is already spoken
for.

Two spellings of one directory are one workspace
------------------------------------------------

Identity is the canonical path -- expanded, user-resolved, symlink-resolved,
through the same `paths.expand_path` every other path-taking surface uses --
and never the string the caller typed. `~/w`, `$HOME/w`, `/tmp/w/../w`, and the
absolute path all collide, which is the entire point: a guard that could be
defeated by typing the path differently would be decoration.

The canonical path is then digested. No host path byte reaches the store, and
`_WORKSPACE_REF` refuses a stored `workspace_ref` that is not a digest handle,
so `privacy: "metadata_only"` is structural here rather than a habit -- the
same discipline `blocked_work_records._PATH_SHAPED` applies for the same
reason. The cost is that a store cannot be read back into a path; a caller that
wants to know whether *its* workspace is bound digests its own path and asks.

Staleness blocks, and never releases
------------------------------------

Freshness is derived at read time from the head record's stamp, the idiom
`action_gate._account_state` uses for account signals and `approval_receipts`
uses for consent, rather than stored as a deadline a reader must trust. A
stored expiry is a second independently writable field: hand-editing one number
would widen the window, while `BINDING_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` cannot be widened
by anything on disk.

A stale binding is refused, not reclaimed. Auto-release would be the background
lease service #820 puts out of scope, and it would be wrong on its own terms: a
binding older than the horizon means nobody reported back, which is not the
same as nobody running. So the refusal names a different reason code from a
fresh conflict and carries a different recovery -- release it explicitly, an
act with an owner -- and reuse stays blocked until someone does.

A binding is not dispatch
-------------------------

The four claims #800 keeps apart are existence, ownership, dispatch, and
result. A binding is the second one and nothing else: it does not say the
directory exists (nothing here stats the filesystem), it does not say an
executor started, and it does not say any work finished. `CLAIM_BOUNDARY` says
so on every record, and `validate_workspace_binding` refuses a record shaped to
assert execution by key name as well as by the closed key set.

Store mechanics
---------------

All of it is `system.append_only_store`, shared with the three families beside
it: the torn-tail-safe binary append under a real OS lock, the
opaque-reference guards, the supersede-chain walk, the digest handles, and the
best-effort mint-failure sidecar. This module adds no store mechanics of its
own; it passes its own key names to the shared walk so its records are not
described as receipts they are not.
