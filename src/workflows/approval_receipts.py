"""Append-only receipts for consent an operator actually gave (issue #807).

An approval receipt records that a human answered a confirmation ladder and
said yes to one escalation: one action, on one named scope, for one owner, in
one run, under one safety-profile revision. Nothing else.

Why this is its own record family and not a field group on the delegation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repo has twice refused a new record family (#811, #818) for a good reason:
a family joins on run id, and a join is where an artifact and its metadata
desynchronize. A field group on the record that already exists cannot go stale
against itself.

Consent is the case that reasoning does not cover. It is created at a different
time from the delegation (when the operator answers, not when the handoff is
built), by a different actor (the operator, not the router), it has its own
lifetime (it goes stale on a clock the delegation knows nothing about, and it
can be revoked while the delegation is untouched), and it must survive a rebuild
of the delegation it approves -- rebuilding a prepared handoff must not silently
re-grant consent, and it must not silently destroy consent either. A field group
is written by whoever writes the record; it cannot express "written by someone
else, before this record existed, and still true after this record is replaced".
That is what makes a separate append-only family right here and wrong there.

What a receipt binds
--------------------

An approval is scoped to exactly five things, and each of them is a separate
refusal with its own code:

    run_id                    -> run_not_approved
    owner                     -> owner_not_approved
    approved_action           -> action_not_approved
    (scope_class, scope_ref)  -> scope_not_approved
    safety_profile_revision   -> safety_revision_not_approved

Matching is equality on every dimension, including the scope pair. There is no
containment, prefix, or subsumption rule anywhere in this module, which is what
makes widening structurally impossible rather than merely unimplemented: an
approval for `src/a.py` satisfies a request for `src/a.py` and nothing else --
not `src/`, not `src/b.py`, not the same path for another owner.

Time bounding
-------------

Freshness is derived at read time from the stored decision stamp, the idiom
`coding/executor_auth_signals.py` uses for limit signals, rather than stored as
a deadline the reader must trust (the `_governance_overrides` shape). Two
reasons. A stored `expires_at` is a second independently writable field: a
hand-edited store widens the window by editing one number, while a window that
lives in `APPROVAL_TTL_SECONDS` here cannot be widened by anything on disk. And
the honest reason -- the `storage_retention` boundary of
`handoff_safety_contract/v1` is still `declared_not_enforced`. #835 made
artifact lifecycle readable, but its cleanup preview is a dry run and this store
is not even one of the families it projects, so nothing deletes an approval
receipt. Claiming an approval "expires" on disk would be a lie about a file that
outlives every window it names, so expiry is a property every reader recomputes
and never a property the artifact has.

A decision stamped in the future is not fresh either. It cannot be shown to be
older than zero seconds, so it is refused rather than clamped, which is the
other half of "the window cannot be widened from disk".

Three separate things
---------------------

`external_effect_receipts` separates requested / attempted / succeeded / failed
/ unknown so a request can never be read as an outcome. The same discipline is
why this family exists separately from that one: approval, attempt, and observed
outcome are three different claims (#800). An approval receipt proves consent
was given. It never proves the host applied the permission, and it never proves
anything ran -- `CLAIM_BOUNDARY` says so on every record, and
`validate_approval_receipt` refuses a record shaped to assert execution, by key
name as well as by the closed key set.

Store mechanics
---------------

Everything else follows `workflows/external_effect_receipts.py`, which is this
repo's proven append-only receipt store: a JSONL appended under
`local_store.file_lock` (a real OS lock on POSIX and on Windows), sorted-keys
lines, an append that terminates an unterminated tail before writing so a short
write cannot swallow the next record, closed vocabularies everywhere including
at render, minting that is idempotent by decision fingerprint, supersession and
revocation as new linked records rather than edits, and a mint entry point that
returns its failures instead of raising into the producer.
