"""Explicit teach-this-workflow drafts: reviewable, structurally inactive skill proposals.

A draft is what a user gets after they explicitly say "turn this into a skill".
It separates the instructions that stay fixed from the inputs that vary per run,
names the preconditions and stop conditions, carries the verification a reviewer
must see pass, and records which user-selected runs it came from and what was
redacted out of them.

Inactive is structural here, not a flag someone remembers to check:

- a draft is stored under `.omh/learning/skill-drafts/`, never under `skills/`,
  and `write_skill_draft` refuses any path that would land in a skills tree;
- a draft is never catalog data, so `builtin_definitions()` never grows and no
  generated `skills/*/SKILL.md` is written;
- the proposed name lives under `proposed_skill_name`, never `name`, so a
  consumer reading `definition["name"]` cannot pick a draft up by accident, and
  a name that collides with an installed skill fails validation;
- an inactive draft carries no copy-ready proposal at all - the proposal is
  minted by activation, so there is nothing to act on before review.

Activation needs two independent things and recomputes both: the generated-output
checks pass (the draft would project to a definition the catalog contract accepts)
AND an explicit human review approves it. Even activated, the draft is a proposal
a person or Hermes Agent `/learn` acts on - never an install.

The redaction denylist is imported from `workflow_learning`; this module does not
keep a second copy of it.
