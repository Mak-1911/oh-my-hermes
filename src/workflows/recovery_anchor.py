"""`recovery_anchor/v1`: what a baseline was, and how a person could return to it.

After risky work a user asks one question -- "how do I undo this safely?" -- and
today nothing in this tree can answer it. There is no recorded baseline
revision, no bounded record of what was already uncommitted when the work
started, and no written recipe. This module is that record and that answer.

It is only ever a record and an answer. OMH performs no rollback here: nothing
in this module runs a command, spawns a process, opens a socket, or creates,
writes, or deletes a single path. An anchor is metadata; guidance is metadata
plus instruction lines a human runs themselves. That is the whole boundary, and
`CLAIM_BOUNDARY` states it on every record so a reader cannot infer otherwise
from a status line.

Three refusals carry the contract, and each is the reason it exists:

- An anchor with no observed baseline stays `prepared`, and a prepared anchor
  is structurally incapable of describing a recovery: `base_revision` is empty
  and `recovery_recipe` is empty, enforced in both directions by
  `validate_recovery_anchor`. "An anchor was prepared" must never read as "you
  can safely undo this", so the prepared shape has nothing to read that way.
- Guidance for a workspace other than the one the anchor was taken in is
  refused outright. A baseline from another checkout cannot describe this one,
  and offering it would be worse than offering nothing.
- `recoverable` is true for exactly one status. `RECOVERABLE_GUIDANCE_STATUSES`
  holds that one member, and the validator checks the flag against it, so an
  absent, invalid, prepared-only, or mismatched anchor cannot report
  recoverability by any path.

Everything stored is bounded metadata. The workspace is a digest handle rather
than a path, which is both the privacy posture the rest of this package uses
and exactly the comparison the mismatch refusal needs. The dirty state is a
digest plus counts plus a bounded, redacted path sample -- never file contents,
and never an unbounded path list.

Nothing here reads a clock. `created_at` and `baseline_observed_at` are
parameters, and neither reaches an id seed or a digest seed, because a value
that changes between two identical observations turns an equality check into a
race -- the kind the slower CI runner loses first.
