"""One truthful answer to "can you do this now?" for one requested outcome.

The defect this closes (#809): OMH could say a connector was installed, that a
host had loaded it, that a probe had reached it, and that an effect had been
recorded through it, but nothing turned those four separate facts into a single
answer to the only question a person asks. Configuration read like capability,
a load read like reachability, and a success from last week read like a success
now.

Two axes, kept apart on purpose, because welding them is the confusion:

* **Evidence tier** -- what class of fact is the strongest thing anyone
  recorded. ``installed`` is a local configuration fact. ``host_observed``
  means a host reported loading the surface. ``usable_observed`` means a host
  reported actually using it. ``used`` means an external-effect receipt records
  a use of *this* outcome. ``stale`` means one of those was true and is now past
  its freshness horizon.
* **State** -- the answer itself: ``ready``, ``blocked``, ``not_observed``,
  ``stale``, ``failed``, with the smallest next action attached to every state
  that is not ``ready``.

Configuration can never reach ``ready`` and the guard is mechanical, not
advisory: :data:`SOURCE_TIERS` says which tiers a source is allowed to claim,
``local_configuration`` may claim only ``installed``, and ``installed`` sits
below the tier level a positive answer requires.

Scoping is by requested OUTCOME, not by connector. Two outcomes over the same
connector routinely have different answers -- the surface may be reachable
while one of the two effects has never succeeded through it -- so surface-level
evidence applies to every outcome that names the surface, and outcome-level
evidence applies only to the outcome it names.

Freshness is derived at READ time from :data:`EXTERNAL_ACTION_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS`,
the way ``coding.action_gate._account_state`` and ``coding.pre_handoff_readiness``
derive theirs. No expiry deadline is written into a record, so shortening the
horizon takes effect on evidence already recorded. ``now`` is a parameter so the
derivation is deterministic under test, and no wall clock is ever placed inside
a compared payload.

Everything here is pure. OMH probes nothing, calls nothing, and reaches no
network: it reads what other surfaces recorded. The store adapters below convert
records those surfaces already write; ``omh_mcp_observation/v1`` and
``omh_evidence_probe/v1`` are deliberately NOT adapted, because neither names a
host or an effect and therefore neither can be scoped to a requested outcome.

    `evidence` is every record a caller gathered. Three things happen to it, in

    1. Each record is validated. An invalid record is rejected and never enters
       the derivation, so bad evidence structurally cannot raise the answer.
    2. Valid records are scoped. Evidence naming another outcome is ignored --
       it is somebody else's truth, not weaker truth about this one -- and
       surface-level evidence applies only to the named surface.
    3. The answer is derived from the strongest positive evidence that is still
       fresh. When nothing in scope is fresh, the answer is `stale`; a stale
       observation is never allowed to read as `ready`.

    `prior` is the last valid answer for this same outcome. It is used for
    exactly one thing (AC3): when records were supplied and none of them
    survived validation and scoping, the prior state is preserved rather than
    overwritten, and the answer says so through `state_source` and
    `rejected_evidence`. A preserved answer never rises above what the prior
    already held, because a prior is itself a derived answer.

    `now` is a parameter so the derivation is deterministic. An unreadable or
    future `observed_at` reads as older than the horizon, for the reason
    `pre_handoff_readiness._stamp_age_seconds` gives: neither can be shown to be
    fresh, and clamping would turn editing a stored timestamp into a way to
