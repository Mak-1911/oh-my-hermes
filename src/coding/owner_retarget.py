"""Move accepted coding work to another owner without replanning it (#812).

The gap this closes. A coding plan is accepted once. The accepted plan decides
the routed workflow, the intent, the acceptance criteria, and the verification
expectations, and none of those four readings depend on who ends up doing the
work --- `build_coding_delegation_payload` computes `payload["delegation"]`
before it ever looks at `executor_target`. What DID depend on the owner was the
only way to change one: `prepare_wrapper_session_handoff` refused every
executor change on a follow-up handoff and offered exactly one escape, "start a
new session". A new session has no accepted plan, so changing owner meant
replanning work the person had already approved and re-deriving criteria they
had already agreed to.

So retargeting is a **re-projection, not a decision**. The same owner-neutral
task contract is rendered through a different owner's handoff projection, and
the only thing Hermes has to explain is the part that genuinely moved.

Three artifacts, all pure and all deterministic (`now` is a parameter, and
nothing here reads a clock, a network, a credential, or a host configuration
file):

* `coding_task_contract/v1` --- the owner-neutral half of one accepted plan.
  Projected from `payload["delegation"]`, whose ten fields are computed with no
  reading of the owner, plus a digest of the equally owner-neutral
  `specialist_work_quality` bar. This is what AC1 protects: the task's scope
  (`intent`, `recommended_workflow`, `recommended_harness`, `work_role`), its
  non-goals and review boundary (`review_required`, `review_workflow`, and the
  `delegation_prompt_template` that states them to the owner), its
  `acceptance_criteria`, and its `verification`.

* `coding_owner_retarget/v1` --- the record of one move. It carries the two
  owners, the preserved contract and its digest, the enumerated owner-specific
  delta, and the capability delta.

* The refusal. `build_owner_retarget` compares the two contracts field by field
  and raises when any of them moved. **A retarget that would change the task
  contract is refused as a replan**, so AC1 is enforced by the builder rather
  than asserted by a test alone.

AC2 --- "enumerate unsupported or changed owner capability before handoff" ---
reuses #810's matcher rather than growing a second one. Requirements come from
`derive_plan_capability_requirements(accepted_plan_from_delegation(...))` and
each owner is classified by `evaluate_owner_fit`. Both owners are judged
against the TARGET plan's requirement set, because "what changed" is only
meaningful on one yardstick; the yardstick's own movement is reported
separately as `required_by_owner_change` / `dropped_by_owner_change`. That
movement is real and is the whole point of the field: retargeting from an
external-executor owner to a runtime owner turns the routed workflow into
something the new owner has to carry locally, which adds a `local_workflow`
requirement that the source plan never had.

AC3 --- no source-host configuration or credential is read. Capability
snapshots arrive as a parameter; absent snapshots classify every requirement
`unknown` (an unproven owner), never a guess. Retargeting is a local
re-projection of two values the caller already holds.

Nothing here is execution. A retarget is not dispatch and not evidence that the
new owner accepted or started anything.
