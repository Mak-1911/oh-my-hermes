"""`handoff_input_manifest/v1` — the bounded context package a coding owner receives.

A user could not tell which files, plan sections, diffs, or reviewed memories a
coding owner was about to receive, whether the package was oversized, or whether
anything in it was unsafe. This module is the answer: one reviewable, bounded,
reproducible manifest that every coding handoff pins by revision and digest.

Superset, not an extension of `handoff_context_pack/v1` (#823)
--------------------------------------------------------------

The pack was the obvious place to grow, and growing it was rejected for three
reasons that are properties of the pack, not preferences:

1. Its items are memory-snapshot summaries. `build_handoff_context_pack` walks
   `inspection["snapshots"]` and nothing else, so a file, a plan heading, and a
   revision range have no shape there. Making them fit would change what a pack
   item *is*, in a contract already frozen at v1.
2. `validate_handoff_context_pack` enforces an allowed-key set and this issue's
   AC1 requires *every* item to carry six new fields. Making them required would
   invalidate every pack alive today — `build_plan_handoff_context_pack`, every
   wrapper-supplied pack read through `read_handoff_context_pack_file`, and the
   stored fixtures. Making them optional would satisfy the letter of AC1 and
   none of its point, because a manifest whose items may omit their hash cannot
   answer "is this package oversized".
3. A pack is prepared *memory* context. A manifest is the whole input package.
   They are different questions and a v1 contract should keep answering the one
   it was built for.

So the manifest is a superset that **references** the pack rather than a second
concept competing with it. When a pack is supplied, its `included_context`
projects into `reviewed_memory` manifest items — same items, one lineage — and
`derived_from` records the pack it came from with the counts the pack itself
reported. The pack keeps validating unchanged and stays the single source of
reviewed memory; the manifest is the single surface a user reviews before the
handoff goes out. Pack exclusions are deliberately *not* re-listed here under a
second vocabulary: the pack already enumerates its own, and `derived_from`
points at it.

Where `safety_result` comes from
--------------------------------

Not from a new judgement. `context_pack` is already an untrusted surface in
`action_gate.UNTRUSTED_SURFACES`, and `action_gate.AUTHORITY_CLASSIFIERS` names
the two classifiers that decide such a surface. This module applies exactly
those two, each to the surface it was written for:

* `classify_memory_admission` reads item **content** — a file's bytes, a plan
  section, a diff, a memory summary. It is the same three-status, fail-closed
  vocabulary the memory-admission lane uses on prohibited material.
* `ensure_safe_opaque_ref_content` reads the item's own **metadata** — the
  selector expression and the workspace-relative local ref, which are exactly
  the single-line opaque references that function exists to screen.

`action_gate.is_authority_shaped` is deliberately *not* the gate. Its docstring
says it is "purely a report", and it is: it routes through
`ensure_safe_opaque_ref_content`, whose unicode screen rejects any control
character, so every multi-line text flags. As a report on a flattened surface
that is the intended conservatism; as an inclusion gate it would exclude every
real file. Reporting and refusing are different jobs and this one refuses.

An item that does not screen `safe` is **excluded with a reason**, never
included and never silently dropped, so the manifest that reaches a handoff
carries only screened material and the refusals stay visible next to it.

Determinism
-----------

There is no timestamp anywhere in this contract, so none can reach the digest
seed. The digest is a pure function of the manifest's content, and the manifest
is a pure function of (selectors, workspace bytes, pack, revision, budget). Two
builds of the same package agree byte for byte, on any platform: local refs are
POSIX-relative, glob expansion is sorted, and item ordering is the order the
caller declared.

`revision` and `digest` are what the handoff pins. Attaching deep-copies the
manifest, so a later edit to the manifest a caller still holds cannot be read as
the one the handoff carried — the handoff keeps naming the old revision and the
old digest, and `input_manifest_pin_matches` recomputes rather than trusting the
stored value, so the mismatch is detectable rather than merely likely.
