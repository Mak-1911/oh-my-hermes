"""Freshness-aware readiness invalidation and the pre-handoff repair card.

The defect this closes (#837): a readiness decision was cached the first time a
coding owner was probed and then reused forever. `_cached_profile` returned any
entry carrying `observed_once`, `updated_at` was written and never read back,
and only `force=True` re-probed. A person who uninstalled `codex`, revoked a
permission, or moved to another checkout still got `ready`, and the handoff was
dispatched into a gap nobody had been told about.

Two derivations live here, both pure and both I/O-free:

* **Freshness.** Age is derived at READ time from the stored `updated_at` plus
  `READINESS_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS`, the way `action_gate._account_state` derives
  `expired` from `ACCOUNT_SIGNAL_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS`. No expiry deadline is
  ever written into the cached record, so shortening the horizon takes effect
  on records already on disk instead of only on records written afterwards.
* **Binding.** A readiness decision is bound to a digest per invalidating axis
  --- profile identity, tool set, permission profile, workspace --- so a
  changed prerequisite invalidates the decision and the verdict can name WHICH
  prerequisite changed. The binding carries no timestamp: it is compared for
  equality, and a wall clock inside a compared payload makes equality a race.

Nothing here decides that a repair happened. The repair card is
`prepared_not_observed`; it names the gap and the command a person may run.

Executor-neutrality (AC3): the card's key set is closed and identical for every
owner. Codex, Claude Code, the Hermes runtime, and generic profiles differ only
in the VALUES of the owner-specific fields (`profile`, `label`,
`missing_prerequisites`, `repair_steps[].command`, `verify_command`).
