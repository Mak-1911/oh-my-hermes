"""Ranked OMH-native opportunities for one user goal, from evidence already on disk.

Somebody knows the outcome they want and does not know which public agent
projects have already solved something like it. The raw form of that question --
search the ecosystem, read what comes back -- answers with implementation names,
and an answer made of implementation names is a shopping list. This module
answers the same question with OMH capability statements instead: what could
Hermes do better for this goal, which OMH capability family covers it today, and
which frozen evidence supports saying so.

What is already here, and what this adds
----------------------------------------

Two rankers exist. `capability_roadmap` ranks missing setup and missing runtime
evidence from a probe payload -- an installation question, the same answer for
every user. `popular_plugin_coverage` weighs request families against OMH case
ids -- a breadth heuristic, again the same answer for every user. Neither is
scoped to a goal, neither applies a source policy, and neither knows whether the
material behind its verdict was read last week or last year.

This module is the goal-scoped one. The same catalog and the same observed
material, asked about a different outcome, returns a different ranking, because
the ranking is a function of the goal.

Coverage is read, never invented
--------------------------------

Every opportunity names a `coverage_family_id` from
`capabilities.families.capability_family_projection`, the projection that
already defines OMH's user-facing capability surface. An id outside it is
refused, and the family's label is copied from the live projection rather than
retyped. There is no second inventory of what OMH can do, so there is nothing to
drift out of sync.

Which family a goal belongs to and how much of it that family already delivers
are two different questions, and only the first has a mechanical answer. The
family and its label are OMH's fact, read from the projection; `coverage_state`
is the caller's judgement about their own goal, and is recorded as such.

The product boundary, enforced rather than requested
----------------------------------------------------

An opportunity's own prose may not name a distributable artifact as the answer.
"Install the review plugin" is a validation error here, not a style note: the
whole point of the workflow is that the user asked how Hermes should improve,
and a package name does not answer that. `PACKAGE_ACQUISITION_CUES` refuses on
its own -- an OMH capability statement never needs the word "install" --  while
`DISTRIBUTABLE_ARTIFACT_CUES` refuses only alongside `ARTIFACT_ADOPTION_CUES`,
because this repository's own boundary language ("must not require a plugin at
runtime") says the word without recommending the thing.

Findings are scanned by exactly the opposite rule: not at all. A finding
describes what an observer read in somebody else's project and naming that
project is the honest thing to do. The prohibition is on the answer, not on the
evidence.

Three evidence states, and none of them reads as another
--------------------------------------------------------

`fresh` means an approved source whose cited snapshot was observed inside the
horizon. `stale` means an approved source whose observation is older than the
horizon or whose age cannot be established at all -- an unparseable or missing
observation time is never fresh. `denied` means the source policy does not admit
one of the cited sources, and nothing about its age is even considered.

Only `fresh` supports an opportunity. An opportunity with no fresh evidence is
not dropped, because silently dropping it would hide the denial that caused it;
it moves to `withheld_opportunities` carrying the reason, so widening the policy
or re-observing the source is a visible next step rather than a guess.

Freshness is derived at read time
---------------------------------

No record here stores an expiry. A cited `capability_inspiration_snapshot/v1`
reports when it was observed; this module subtracts that from the `now` it was
handed and compares against a horizon supplied by the same call. Two callers
with different horizons get different verdicts from the same snapshot, which is
correct -- how long evidence stays good is a policy, not a property of the
evidence -- and a snapshot never has to be rewritten because time passed.

`now` is a parameter and this module reads no clock. It lands in `evaluated_at`
for a reader, and it is excluded from `report_id`, so two scouts of the same
material at different moments agree unless a verdict actually moved. A timestamp
inside a compared value would make every comparison a race.

OMH does not search
-------------------

Every byte of observed material arrives from the caller, frozen in snapshots
somebody else already wrote. This module imports nothing that can open a socket
and calls nothing that can. The `claim_boundary` on the report says so, because
the failure this guards against is a reader treating a ranked opportunity as
proof that OMH just surveyed the ecosystem. It did not, and it cannot.
