"""Every OMH-facing local name that a second visible source also claims.

Doctor already scanned foreign configured skill directories for names matching
OMH's core skills. Three things were missing, and #815 needs all three.

Coverage. The scan saw skill directory names and nothing else. The two other
surfaces carrying an OMH-facing name -- the tools the managed bridge registers
and the lifecycle hooks it subscribes to -- were invisible, so "why did a
familiar command trigger the wrong workflow" had no answer at all when the
competing source was a second local plugin rather than a second skill directory.

Attribution. A collision was one line of text naming the foreign directory. It
never said which side of the contest OMH owns, so an operator could not tell
"OMH installed this twice" from "something else took the name", and those need
opposite repairs. Ownership here is read from the install manifests --
`manifest.json` for skills, `.omh-plugin-manifest.json` for the bridge -- never
inferred from what a path looks like. A directory named `omh` that OMH did not
install is precisely the case the attribution exists to catch, and a path-shaped
guess would call it OMH's own.

Precedence. OMH cannot read Hermes' resolution order from here, so a contested
name is reported as `unknown` and never as a resolved winner. `uncontested` is
reserved for a scan that actually enumerated every source and found no contest;
an unreadable directory or a Hermes config that could not be read keeps the
answer `unknown`, because "nothing was found" and "nothing was looked at" are
different statements.

Nothing in this module writes, moves, renames, or deletes. It reads directory
names, `plugin.yaml` declarations, and two manifests, and returns a report. The
repair it names is always the operator's to perform.

#   blocking -- `command`. Hermes exposes one tool per name to the model, so a
#     second local plugin declaring `omh_status` means at most one of the two
#     registrations answers and OMH cannot say which. The user-visible result is
#     a capability that is installed and absent at the same time; no phrasing in
#     chat recovers it, and every other doctor check still reports green.
#
#   warning -- `skill` and `hook`. Both sides stay installed and reachable. A
#     shadowed skill directory still resolves to whichever source wins and the
#     other workflow can be asked for by name, and Hermes' hook names are
#     lifecycle events that every plugin subscribes to, so an overlap there is a
#     second subscriber rather than a stolen slot. Worth reporting -- it is the
#     honest answer to "why did that trigger the wrong workflow" -- and not
#     worth failing an install over.
