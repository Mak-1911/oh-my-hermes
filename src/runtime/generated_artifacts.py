"""Which locally generated artifact is current, and which one is safe to remove (issue #835).

OMH writes plans, plan variants, operation reports, and skill drafts into local
stores and never takes any of them back. A user looking at four files with
similar names has no way to tell which one a handoff still points at, which one
was replaced, or which one could go. This module answers that from what the
producers already wrote.

A read-side projection, not new producer metadata
-------------------------------------------------

Nothing here is stamped onto an artifact at write time. `generated_artifact/v1`
is derived on read from data the producing workflows already persist: the file
itself (its digest and, for plans, the timestamp its own writer put in the
name), the producer's status word, the identity field that says which artifact
is another revision of the same thing, and every local file that names it. No
producing workflow is touched, so an artifact written before this module existed
projects exactly like one written after.

What "superseded" means here
----------------------------

Each kind declares a *revision line* -- the field that says two artifacts are
two revisions of one thing -- and an *ordering key* that says which came second:

    hermes_plan         line = task_statement_sha256   order = the stamp its writer put in the filename
    operation_artifact  line = surface|kind|title      order = created_at
    plan_variant        line = parent digest|name      order = created_at
    skill_draft         line = proposed_skill_name     order = created_at

The newest member of a line is `current`; every earlier member is `superseded`
and names the artifact that replaced it. A plan whose own frontmatter already
says `superseded` is superseded regardless of position.

Ordering fails closed. If two members of one line carry no readable creation
time, or carry the same one, nothing in the line is called superseded --
guessing which of two files replaced the other is exactly the mistake that would
put a live artifact on a cleanup list.

Deletion
--------

There is none. `build_generated_artifact_cleanup_preview` is a dry run: it
reports what *would* be eligible and why, and this module contains no unlink,
no remove, no rmtree, and no write of any kind.
`tests/test_generated_artifact_cleanup.py` walks this module's AST and fails if
one appears.

Cleanup eligibility
-------------------

An artifact is eligible only when all three hold, and the record says which one
failed when it is not:

1. it is superseded -- a current artifact is never eligible;
2. no local artifact references it -- see the scan below;
3. its retention window has ended, measured from its creation time against the
   caller's `now`.

"Referenced" is a real reverse scan, not a guess. Every reference-source file is
read and every string in it is collected, so a handoff context pack that pins a
plan by path, a run's coding delegation that pins it by path and digest, a
variant that names its parent plan, and a report that cites another artifact all
count. Two matches are deliberately not counted: an artifact never references
itself, and a content digest that more than one stored artifact answers to
identifies none of them, so it is not a reference key for any of them (see
`_ambiguous_digests` -- re-planning one task writes byte-identical files).

The observation journal is deliberately *not* a reference source. It is an
append-only history, so every artifact ever written appears in it; treating
history as a live pin would make the eligible set empty by construction and the
whole preview useless. A reference here means something that would be left
dangling if the file went away.

Determinism
-----------

`now` is a required parameter, never a clock read, because the retention verdict
depends on it and a projection whose answer changes between two calls in the
same second cannot be compared or tested. Nothing else in a record comes from
the clock.
