# Feedback Triage

This is a Hermes-native `feedback-triage` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`feedback-triage` exists to keep customer and community signals from jumping straight into roadmap or coding; it clusters evidence, ranks signals, and chooses the next workflow.

## Do Not Use When

- The request already contains an accepted product decision and asks for implementation.
- There are no feedback items, source boundary, or product area to classify.
- The user wants current market research rather than triage of supplied signals.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Cluster these customer payment failure reports and feature requests before we plan fixes.
- Expected behavior: Cluster bug signals and feature asks, rank severity or opportunity, and recommend research, planning, or coding as a next workflow.
- Why: The input is mixed feedback that needs classification before delivery decisions.

Bad example:

- Prompt: feedback-triage implement the accepted billing fix now.
- Expected behavior: Route to planning or coding handoff instead of re-triaging.
- Why: The decision is already accepted, so triage would add delay without improving evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The source boundary, signal clusters, severity, and follow-up lane are named.
- Bug, feature, research, strategy, and coding handoff outcomes stay separate.
- The next workflow is recommended before any implementation claim.

## Recovery Notes

- If feedback lacks source or severity, ask for the missing signal before coding handoff.
- If the item is actually a plan or research request, route to that workflow instead of triage.

## OMH Context Rail

- This skill is part of OMH's Hermes workflow layer, not a standalone executor.
- Product context: OMH is a Hermes-native workflow pack: choose skills, shape work, prepare artifacts, show status, and hand off with evidence boundaries.
- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`source-finder`, `web-research`, `best-practice-research`, `autoresearch-goal`, `research-brief`, `strategy-brief`, `feedback-triage`, `research-department`, `+6 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Cross-skill context: every OMH skill: match lane; generic tool can render or execute.
- Generic-tool checkpoint: image->img-summary; frontend->frontend/a11y/visual-qa; paper->paper-learning; content->content-operator; media->media-input-operator; file->materials-package; search->web-research; live->live-info-operator; audit->workspace/production/security; failures->build-failure; verify->verification-gate; code->codegraph/onboarding/ultraprocess.
- Coverage: Every generated workflow skill carries this rail.
- Normal users talk to Hermes; OMH CLI is infra.
- Boundary: Prepared OMH routing/cards/handoffs/artifacts are not observed execution, image generation, delivery, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should classify feedback, bug reports, and feature asks before deciding whether research, planning, or coding handoff is needed.

    Strong routing signals: `feedback-triage`, `customer-feedback-triage`, `feedback triage`, `customer feedback`, `feedback cluster`, `bug or feature`, `feature request triage`, `payment failure feedback`, `feedback trends`, `payment failure`, `payment failure issue`, `payment failure reports`, `고객 피드백`, `피드백`, `피드백 분류`, `피드백을 모아서`, `결제 실패`, `결제 실패 이슈`, `결제 실패 피드백`, `결제 오류`, `고객 불만`, `버그 제보`, `버그 기능 요청`, `기능 요청`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `triage`
Phase: `feedback`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `triage-gated`

Quality bar:

- Name the source boundary before clustering feedback.
- Classify signals into bug, feature, research, or strategy follow-up without overclaiming evidence.
- Recommend the next workflow instead of jumping straight to coding.

Handoff policy:

Keep feedback triage in Hermes; recommend the next workflow and prepare a selected executor/runtime handoff only after explicit coding intent or accepted plan evidence.

Required inputs:

- feedback items or summary
- source boundary
- product area

Expected outputs:

- clusters
- severity or opportunity ranking
- next workflow recommendation
- product_evidence_loop/v1

Artifact expectations:

- feedback triage record when a wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- Do not turn feedback into a roadmap, implementation plan, or coding handoff by default.
- Separate bug signal, feature ask, severity, opportunity, and missing evidence.
- Route code changes only after explicit user intent or accepted planning evidence.
- product_evidence_loop/v1 is prepared-only opaque references, not observed evidence or execution.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `customer-insight-triage`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill feedback-triage --harness customer-insight-triage --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available; do not require unavailable runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays. If a capability is unavailable: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.
- Respect `omh_target_topology/v1`: bind state to the current target/thread, use single-target behavior when `active_agent_count` is one, and name a one-to-many or many-to-one change before treating it as persistent.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
- Shared rail: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md` has harness discipline, runtime translations, the delegation command, and execution checklist. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
