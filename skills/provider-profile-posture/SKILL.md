# Provider Profile Posture

This is a Hermes-native `provider-profile-posture` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`provider-profile-posture` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and receive a structured, evidence-bounded OMH operating surface instead of ad hoc narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Prepare provider profile posture for this connector using metadata-only secret presence.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_provider_profile_posture` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Read the secret, validate the credential, call the provider, or create a payment route.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Provider ID, profile ID, requested capabilities, and secret-presence metadata are explicit.
- No secret value, credential validation, provider call, model route, wallet, or payment action is claimed.
- Any host observation reference remains supplied metadata, not a live connector check.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## OMH Context Rail

- This skill is part of OMH's Hermes workflow layer, not a standalone executor.
- Product context: OMH is a Hermes-native workflow pack: choose skills, shape work, prepare artifacts, show status, and hand off with evidence boundaries.
- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `voice-operator`, `+31 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Cross-skill context: every OMH skill: match lane; generic tool can render or execute.
- Generic-tool checkpoint: image->img-summary; frontend->frontend/a11y/visual-qa; paper->paper-learning; content->content-operator; media->media-input-operator; file->materials-package; search->web-research; live->live-info-operator; audit->workspace/production/security; failures->build-failure; verify->verification-gate; code->codegraph/onboarding/ultraprocess.
- Coverage: Every generated workflow skill carries this rail.
- Normal users talk to Hermes; OMH CLI is infra.
- Boundary: Prepared OMH routing/cards/handoffs/artifacts are not observed execution, image generation, delivery, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Use When

Use for provider/profile capability and secret-presence preparation before connector or credential action.

    Strong routing signals: `provider-profile-posture`, `provider profile posture`, `provider profile readiness`, `secret presence confirmation`, `connector profile posture`, `공급자 프로필 상태`, `시크릿 존재 확인`, `커넥터 준비 상태`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `provider-profile-posture`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- provider_profile_posture/v1
- metadata-only secret requirements
- allowed and prohibited actions

Artifact expectations:

- provider_profile_posture/v1 metadata-only preparation record

Safety rules:

- Provider/profile posture is OMH-local preparation metadata; it is not credential validation, provider connectivity, model routing, payment/wallet, or host execution evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `provider-profile-posture`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill provider-profile-posture --harness provider-profile-posture --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available; do not require unavailable runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays. If a capability is unavailable: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.
- Respect `omh_target_topology/v1`: bind state to the current target/thread, use single-target behavior when `active_agent_count` is one, and name a one-to-many or many-to-one change before treating it as persistent.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
- Shared rail: `oh-my-hermes/references/skill-common-rail.md` has harness discipline, runtime translations, the delegation command, and execution checklist. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
