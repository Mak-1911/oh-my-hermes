# Report Package

This is a Hermes-native `report-package` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`report-package` exists to make reporting a first-class operations surface: Hermes can produce clean report and slide outlines while keeping approvals, delivery, and binary deck export as separate evidence.

## Do Not Use When

- The user needs SLO, incident, or error-budget review; use `reliability-review`.
- The user asks for a live `.pptx` deck file rather than a PPT-ready outline.
- The request is meeting minutes, scrum history, or action-item tracking.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: report-package 월간 리더십 보고서 PPT outline 만들어줘.
- Expected behavior: Prepare a report package with sections, assumptions, missing inputs, and Markdown/JSON outline scope.
- Why: The request is packaging known information for reporting, not reliability validation or code work.

Bad example:

- Prompt: report-package prove our SLO passed and close the incident.
- Expected behavior: Route to `reliability-review` and require metric or incident evidence.
- Why: Report packaging cannot satisfy reliability closure evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The reporting window, inputs, audience, narrative, and evidence gaps are named.
- Draft report, generated package, approval, and delivery are separate states.
- The next action says whether to gather evidence, generate, revise, approve, or deliver.

## Recovery Notes

- If input evidence is incomplete, mark the section as pending rather than fabricating a report claim.
- If delivery or attachment is unavailable, keep the report package prepared_not_observed.

## OMH Context Rail

- This skill is part of OMH's Hermes workflow layer, not a standalone executor.
- Product context: OMH is a Hermes-native workflow pack: choose skills, shape work, prepare artifacts, show status, and hand off with evidence boundaries.
- Current lane: **Materials and visual summaries** (`design-orchestration`, `design-quality-gate`, `frontend`, `accessibility-audit`, `visual-qa`, `content-operator`, `media-input-operator`, `materials-package`, `+4 more`) - web, accessibility, visual QA, files, and packages.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Cross-skill context: every OMH skill: match lane; generic tool can render or execute.
- Generic-tool checkpoint: image->img-summary; frontend->frontend/a11y/visual-qa; paper->paper-learning; content->content-operator; media->media-input-operator; file->materials-package; search->web-research; live->live-info-operator; audit->workspace/production/security; failures->build-failure; verify->verification-gate; code->codegraph/onboarding/ultraprocess.
- Coverage: Every generated workflow skill carries this rail.
- Normal users talk to Hermes; OMH CLI is infra.
- Boundary: Prepared OMH routing/cards/handoffs/artifacts are not observed execution, image generation, delivery, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should turn supplied inputs into a report, executive brief, PPT-ready outline, or upload package without claiming presentation delivery.

    Strong routing signals: `report-package`, `report package`, `weekly report`, `monthly report`, `executive report`, `exec brief`, `leadership deck`, `status package`, `ppt outline`, `presentation outline`, `slide outline`, `upload package`, `보고서 패키지`, `주간 보고서`, `월간 보고서`, `경영진 보고`, `리더십 보고`, `PPT`, `피피티`, `슬라이드`, `발표자료`, `업로드 패키지`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `reporting`
Phase: `package-outline`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `report-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name audience, reporting period, sections, supplied facts, assumptions, and missing data.
- Keep report packaging independent from reliability review unless explicitly requested.
- Export only Markdown/JSON outlines unless a separate presentation tool produces a binary deck.

Handoff policy:

Keep report narrative, sectioning, and Markdown/JSON outline packaging in Hermes; do not require reliability evidence unless the user asks for a reliability review.

Required inputs:

- audience
- reporting period or scope
- supplied facts
- missing data or assumptions

Expected outputs:

- report package
- PPT-ready Markdown or JSON outline
- assumptions and missing-input list
- optional achievements badge section sourced from `omh achievements export --format md` when requested

Artifact expectations:

- operation_artifact/v1 report-package artifact when a wrapper or CLI records it

Safety rules:

- Do not claim source review completion from a prepared report package.
- Do not claim stakeholder approval or presentation delivery without observed evidence.
- Do not couple report packages to SLO, incident, or error-budget evidence by default.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `report-package`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill report-package --harness report-package --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available; do not require unavailable runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays. If a capability is unavailable: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.
- Respect `omh_target_topology/v1`: bind state to the current target/thread, use single-target behavior when `active_agent_count` is one, and name a one-to-many or many-to-one change before treating it as persistent.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
- Shared rail: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md` has harness discipline, runtime translations, the delegation command, and execution checklist. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
