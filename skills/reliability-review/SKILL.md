# Reliability Review

This is a Hermes-native `reliability-review` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`reliability-review` exists to make SRE-style review strict: service reliability claims must point to metrics or references, and remediation remains separate from the review narrative.

## Do Not Use When

- The user only needs a generic status report or leadership deck.
- No service, incident, SLO, metric, or reliability source boundary is available.
- The request is implementation of remediation rather than review of reliability evidence.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: reliability-review 장애 포스트모템과 SLO 에러버짓 상태를 검토해줘.
- Expected behavior: Prepare a reliability artifact that separates metrics/references, assumptions, missing evidence, and remediation follow-ups.
- Why: The request is reliability evidence review with closure-sensitive claims.

Bad example:

- Prompt: reliability-review make a monthly PPT report for leadership.
- Expected behavior: Use `report-package` unless the report specifically asks for reliability evidence review.
- Why: Report packaging and reliability validation are independent operations surfaces.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## OMH Context Rail

- This skill is part of OMH's Hermes workflow layer, not a standalone executor.
- Product context: OMH is a Hermes-native workflow pack: choose skills, shape work, prepare artifacts, show status, and hand off with evidence boundaries.
- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`source-finder`, `web-research`, `best-practice-research`, `autoresearch-goal`, `research-brief`, `strategy-brief`, `feedback-triage`, `research-department`, `+6 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Cross-skill context: every OMH skill: match lane; generic tool can render or execute.
- Generic-tool checkpoint: image->img-summary; frontend->frontend/a11y/visual-qa; paper->paper-learning; content->content-operator; media->media-input-operator; file->materials-package; search->web-research; live->live-info-operator; audit->workspace/production/security; failures->build-failure; verify->verification-gate; code->codegraph/onboarding/ultraprocess.
- Coverage: Every generated workflow skill carries this rail.
- Normal users talk to Hermes; OMH CLI is infra.
- Boundary: Prepared OMH routing/cards/handoffs/artifacts are not observed execution, image generation, delivery, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should review incident notes, SLOs, error budgets, or service reliability evidence while keeping remediation and closure claims observed.

    Strong routing signals: `reliability-review`, `reliability review`, `incident review`, `incident postmortem`, `postmortem`, `post-mortem`, `slo review`, `slo`, `sla`, `error budget`, `service reliability`, `reliability followup`, `remediation tracking`, `sre review`, `장애 리뷰`, `장애 회고`, `포스트모템`, `사후 분석`, `에러버짓`, `에러 버짓`, `서비스 신뢰성`, `신뢰성 검증`, `재발 방지`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `reliability`
Phase: `incident-and-slo-review`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `reliability-gated`

Quality bar:

- Name service, incident/time window, SLO/error-budget target, source references, and missing observations.
- Separate supplied metrics, incident notes, assumptions, and remediation follow-ups.
- Keep closure and remediation status unobserved until evidence is supplied.

Handoff policy:

Keep incident/SLO/error-budget review in Hermes; prepare remediation handoffs only after an accepted fix direction exists and record closure only from observed evidence.

Required inputs:

- service or incident scope
- time window
- metric/source references
- known remediation items or gaps

Expected outputs:

- reliability review
- evidence and missing-evidence list
- remediation follow-up boundary

Artifact expectations:

- operation_artifact/v1 reliability-review artifact when a wrapper or CLI records it

Safety rules:

- Do not claim SLO pass, healthy error budget, incident closure, or remediation completion without source, metric, or reference evidence.
- Do not treat a reliability narrative as verification, review, CI, merge, or deploy evidence.
- Route code remediation through a separate accepted plan or executor handoff.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `reliability-review`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill reliability-review --harness reliability-review --status started
```

Record observed delegation results when Hermes or the wrapper exposes them. If delegation is unavailable, keep the result explicit as `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve the workflow intent, stop conditions, and verification discipline; verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available, and do not require runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays that Hermes Agent does not expose. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and fall back: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.
- Respect `omh_target_topology/v1` when a wrapper reports it: bind state to the current target/thread, fall back to single-target behavior when `active_agent_count` is one, and give one concise setup-change comment before treating a one-to-many or many-to-one change as persistent.
- Treat wrapper-supplied memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof that opaque Hermes memory was read or changed.
- Shared rail: `oh-my-hermes/references/skill-common-rail.md` carries harness discipline, the runtime-mechanism translation table, the delegation-record command, and the execution-rule checklist. Load it when one of those applies; if it is not installed, name the unavailable capability instead of assuming it.
