# Context Budget Review

This is a Hermes-native `context-budget-review` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`context-budget-review` ports ECC's context-budget and token-budget instincts into OMH as a compactness gate that protects long-running work without redefining success around a smaller task.

## Do Not Use When

- The user asks for live token/cost telemetry; use `ops-observability-card`.
- The user asks to continue a loopable goal; use `loop` unless budget planning is the explicit blocker.
- The task is a short one-step answer with no meaningful context risk.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: context-budget-review 이 장기 PR 작업에서 어떤 맥락을 꼭 유지하고 언제 요약해야 하는지 잡아줘.
- Expected behavior: Prepare context_budget_plan/v1, must_keep_context_pack/v1, checkpoint plan, risk register, and overflow recovery route.
- Why: The request is about preserving context quality during long-running agent work.

Bad example:

- Prompt: context-budget-review 토큰 아끼려고 원래 목표를 더 작은 목표로 바꿔줘.
- Expected behavior: Reject goal shrinking and instead compact context while preserving the full objective and evidence gaps.
- Why: Budget review optimizes context handling, not the user's requested end state.

## Completion Checklist

- The run or workflow scope, metric window, failure modes, and cost/latency boundary are named.
- Local telemetry, provider truth, billing truth, and completion evidence are separate states.
- Warnings name the next measurement or operator review action.

## Recovery Notes

- If provider metrics are unavailable, report only local metadata and mark provider truth not_observed.
- If cost or latency looks risky, surface a warning plus the next measurement rather than a completion claim.

## OMH Context Rail

- This skill is part of OMH's Hermes workflow layer, not a standalone executor.
- Product context: OMH is a Hermes-native workflow pack: choose skills, shape work, prepare artifacts, show status, and hand off with evidence boundaries.
- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `voice-operator`, `+31 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Cross-skill context: every OMH skill: match lane; generic tool can render or execute.
- Generic-tool checkpoint: image->img-summary; frontend->frontend/a11y/visual-qa; paper->paper-learning; content->content-operator; media->media-input-operator; file->materials-package; search->web-research; live->live-info-operator; audit->workspace/production/security; failures->build-failure; verify->verification-gate; code->codegraph/onboarding/ultraprocess.
- Coverage: Every generated workflow skill carries this rail.
- Normal users talk to Hermes; OMH CLI is infra.
- Boundary: Prepared OMH routing/cards/handoffs/artifacts are not observed execution, image generation, delivery, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Use When

Use before long-running research, coding, review, or multi-agent work when context, token, cost, or summary drift could break quality.

    Strong routing signals: `context-budget-review`, `context budget review`, `context budget`, `token budget review`, `token budget`, `prompt budget`, `context compaction`, `compact context`, `too much context`, `summarization checkpoint`, `budget this task`, `컨텍스트 예산`, `토큰 예산`, `컨텍스트 압축`, `요약 체크포인트`

Category: `observability`
Phase: `context-budget-review`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `context-budget-gated`

Quality bar:

- Name must-keep context before summarizing or delegating long work.
- Separate durable requirements, volatile status, file refs, verification evidence, and open blockers.
- Define checkpoint cadence, overflow recovery, and continuity verification.
- Use bounded copy while preserving the full objective and evidence gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep budget design and status narration in Hermes. Provider billing, exact token usage, runtime compaction, and executor cost evidence require observed wrapper, runtime, or provider data.

Required inputs:

- task or workflow scope
- expected duration, artifacts, and handoff surfaces
- available context sources and must-keep facts
- token, cost, latency, or message-size constraints when known

Expected outputs:

- context_budget_plan/v1
- must_keep_context_pack/v1
- summarization_checkpoint_plan/v1
- budget_risk_register/v1
- overflow_recovery_route/v1
- not-evidence boundary

Artifact expectations:

- context_budget_plan/v1 with scope, max visible context, source priority, discard rules, and checkpoint cadence
- must_keep_context_pack/v1 with durable facts, file refs, decisions, PR/CI state, and blocked assumptions
- summarization_checkpoint_plan/v1 with when to compact, what to preserve, and how to verify continuity
- budget_risk_register/v1 separating estimated cost/token/latency risk from provider-observed truth

Safety rules:

- Do not claim provider billing, exact token counts, or runtime compaction occurred without observed evidence.
- Do not drop user requirements, file paths, PR state, verification gaps, or explicit constraints during compaction.
- Keep estimated budget risk, observed usage, checkpoint summaries, and completion evidence separate.
- Do not use budget pressure as a reason to shrink the user's requested end state.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `context-budget-review`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill context-budget-review --harness context-budget-review --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available; do not require unavailable runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays. If a capability is unavailable: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.
- Respect `omh_target_topology/v1`: bind state to the current target/thread, use single-target behavior when `active_agent_count` is one, and name a one-to-many or many-to-one change before treating it as persistent.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
- Shared rail: `oh-my-hermes/references/skill-common-rail.md` has harness discipline, runtime translations, the delegation command, and execution checklist. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
