# OMH Skill Common Rail

Every generated OMH workflow skill shares this policy. It is kept here once instead of
inside each `SKILL.md` so an install does not pay the same bytes 88 times per turn.
Each workflow skill still states its own harness, its own runtime-record command, its
own evidence boundary, and a pointer to this file.

Load this reference when harness selection, a missing Hermes runtime capability,
multi-agent target topology, or the generic execution checklist is in play.

## Harness Discipline

- Start from the representative harness registry in `oh-my-hermes` when the workflow needs coding, research, planning, goal execution, architecture, critique, QA, or documentation lanes.
- Prefer richer evidence and clearer stop conditions over adding more workflow names.
- Use specialist lanes only when they change the quality of the answer or verification.

## Runtime Mechanism Translation

When a runtime-specific mechanism appears in imported instructions, translate it to a
Hermes-native artifact:

- goal tools -> `.omh/goals/` ledgers, `goal_completion_gate/v1`, `goal_status_card/v1`, `goal_continuation/v1`, or explicit checklists with named next actions,
- question renderers -> one concise question in the current Hermes interface,
- native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes,
- shell bridge commands -> optional bridge mode only.

## Delegation Records

Skills record their own start with `omh runtime record --skill <name> --harness <harness> --status started`.
The delegation result is generic:

```sh
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record observed delegation results when Hermes or the wrapper exposes them. If delegation is
unavailable, keep the result explicit as `not_available` or `not_observed`. A recorded run is
preparation, not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Multi-Agent Target Awareness

Respect `omh_target_topology/v1` when a wrapper reports it: bind state to the current target/thread, adapt only the parts of this workflow that benefit from multiple Hermes agents, and fall back to single-target behavior when `active_agent_count` is one.

When target topology changes from one to many or many to one, give a concise setup-change comment or use the wrapper's apply action before treating the new topology as persistent.

## Memory Context

When wrapper metadata includes `memory_review_card/v1` or `handoff_context_pack/v1`, treat it as reviewed OMH-local or wrapper-supplied context only. Use conflict-free context summaries to shape plans and handoffs, but do not claim Hermes internal memory was read or changed.

## Execution Rules

1. Load supporting context with `skills_list` / `skill_view` when needed.
2. State the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
3. Keep progress evidence-backed.
4. Verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
5. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and use the fallback above.
